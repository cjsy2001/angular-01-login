Scenario: When user is signing in for the very first time
Solution: User security function (azure function)
Implement user profile orchestrator function in user security function.

Auth0 Action Triggers → Sets temporary claims indicating: profile_setup_in_progress: true 
federated_user: true 
setup_status: "pending" 
Minimal user info (sub, email, etc.) 
Interim Page → User sees loading spinner with temporary token 
Orchestration includesCreate user 
Query personas by org id and user groups 
Grant application entitlements and permissions 
Create virtual login credentials (if required)
Notify client-hub about profile setup success or failrure.
Strategy: Conditional Processing in Federated Action
Core Approach
Add a profile setup status check before attempting to fetch entitlements. The Action should:

First check: Is this user's profile setup complete in your enterprise system? 
If incomplete: Set interim claims and skip entitlement fetching 
If complete: Proceed with existing org/groups → entitlements flow 
Profile Setup Status Detection

Check against your user service or profile setup service 
Could be based on user existence, completion flags, or timing 
Similar API call pattern as your existing entitlements service 
Interim Claims Strategy
When profile setup is in progress, set:

profile_setup_in_progress: true 
setup_status: 'pending' 
org: [from IdP claims] (so you know which org they belong to) 
federated: true 
Skip the entitlements API call entirely 
Token Refresh Trigger

When SignalR notifies profile setup completion 
Frontend triggers token refresh (checkSession or similar) 
Action runs again, now finds complete profile 
Makes entitlements API call and sets full claims 
User gets redirected to main application 
Benefits

No API failures: Won't call entitlements service for incomplete profiles 
Preserves existing logic: Your org/groups → entitlements flow stays intact 
Smooth transition: From interim claims to full entitlements seamlessly 
Org context maintained: Even interim users know their org assignment 
Key Decision Point
How will you determine if profile setup is complete? Options:

Separate API call to profile setup service 
Check user existence in your user service 
Use timestamp/flag in Auth0 user metadata 
Check if required fields are populated in your backend systems 
The strategy leverages your existing federated Action structure while adding the interim state handling as a pre-flight check before the entitlements processing.
